I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series and learning how to use Phaser to develop video games. It answered a lot of questions I used to have about how things are done in game development. 

I followed along with the tutorials from start to finish and was able to get the final result to run without errors. Therefore, I feel like I should get full credit on the assignment.

Some challenges that I faced included incorrectly capitalizing some variables, which caused confusion in the code. Additionally, I had accidentally pasted the wrong stuff in Scene 1 at one point which took me a while to figure out.

Time spent on this assignment: 8 hours
